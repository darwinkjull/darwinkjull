## Hi, I'm Darwin! 😄

I'm an undergraduate Biomedical Engineering student at Carleton University. I'm passionate about creating person-centered solutions, especially in a medical context⚕️.

Currently, I'm taking my first steps into the world of ML, using Numpy and Scikit-Learn 🧮.

I'm also working on my fourth-year capstone project. My team is developing an application to help educate parents on best practices for SIDS 📱.

From 2021-2024 I was the Avionics Lead for the [CU InSpace](https://github.com/CarletonURocketry) 🚀 design team at Carleton University. Our avionics subteam is responsible for the development of the hardware and software systems that allow the rocket to deploy parachutes 🪂, track its location in real time 🛰️, and transmit telemetry 📻.
