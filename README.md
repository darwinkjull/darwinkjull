### Hi, I'm Darwin! 😄

I'm an undergraduate Biomedical Engineering student at Carleton University. I'm passionate about creating person-centered solutions, especially in a medical context⚕️.

I'm also the Avionics Lead for the [CU InSpace](https://github.com/CarletonURocketry) 🚀 design team at Carleton University. Our avionics subteam is responsible for the development of the hardware and software systems that allow the rocket to deploy parachutes 🪂, track its location in real time 🛰️, and transmit telemetry 📻.

As my good friend [Matteo](https://github.com/linguini1) would say- Yes, I'm a neovim user. You can find my config [here](https://github.com/darwinkjull/nvim).
